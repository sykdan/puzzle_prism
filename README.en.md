# Puzzle Prism
is a VR game made in the Godot game engine (version 4.2).
This project is part of my [exam of Maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matura). See the `latex` branch for the accompanying thesis (in Czech).

## Building
To build the game, use the Godot Engine editor only.
The game has been tested and works on:
Hra byla testov√°na a funguje na:
- Windows using Oculus (Rift and Quest) or SteamVR (all others)
- Android-based headsets (e.g. Quest)
- Some Chromium browsers using WebXR
To build for android you'll need tbe Android SDK and Java 17. Consult Godot documentation for setup instructions.
