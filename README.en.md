# the Puzzle Prism
... is a VR Puzzle game made with Godot 4 (4.2).  
This project is part of my [exam of Maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matura). See the `latex` branch for the accompanying thesis (in Czech).

## Building
Use the Godot Editor to build the game. Only Windows, Android-based VR headsets and WebXR are known to work at this time. The Android version requires that the corresponding XR plugins be installed, for which you'll also need Gradle.
